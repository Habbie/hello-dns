# Non-IETF DNS standards

 * RPZ:
   Response Policy Zone is a framework for blocking, dropping queries or  
   spoofing responses based on domain names, response IP addresses or  
   nameservers used during resolution. It has long lived as an [ISC Technical
   Note](https://ftp.isc.org/isc/dnsrpz/isc-tn-2010-1.txt), and failed to become an IETF standard. It is nevertheless very
   useful, and there is an industry of RPZ providers. Policies are described
   by zones and are typically transmitted over IXFR.
 * RRL: Response Rate Limiting
 * DNSCrypt
 * Curvedns
